1.	There are different interpretations of artificial intelligence in different contexts. Please elaborate on the artificial intelligence in your eyes.

In my view, AI is the simulation of human by intelligence, computation and human providing information, knowledge, and data to feed into artificial intelligence. It can be said that without data or hardware there will be no AI

2.	Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are three concepts often mentioned together. What is the relationship between them? What are the similarities and differences between the three terms?

Relationship: Machine learning and deep learning are divisions within the field of artificial intelligence. In other words, machine learning is AI that can automatically adapt with minimal human intervention. Deep learning is branch of machine learning that uses neural networks to learn from the human brain

Difference:

+Artificial intelligence : a program used to sense, think and adapt to all activities

+Machine learning : the use of algorithms to improve performance when a lot of data over a long period of time is exposed to each other

+Deep learning: using neural networks to process big data

3.	After reading the artificial intelligence application scenarios in this chapter, please describe in detail a field of AI application and its scenarios in real life based on your own life experience.

Artificial intelligence is growing day by day and it is used in everyday life. A typical example is Google, it helps you find a lot of useful information and thereby helps people understand more things in the world that you just need to stay at home and see articles or information about introduction. about beautiful places in the world. Not only that, it helps students learn very useful knowledge or materials. Through that, Google is growing thanks to the use of artificial intelligence.

4.	Which chip is for deep neural networks and Ascend AI processors. Please brief these four major modules.

CANN ( Compute Architecture For Neural Network) là chip do Huawei sản xuất dùng cho mạng thần kinh sâu và bộ xử lý Assend AI.

-Four major modules : 

+Fusion engine : used to implement consolidation of transport operators thereby minimizing movement memory between transport operators and improving efficiency

+CCE oReator Library: This is a deeply optimized generic operator library that can meet most of the needs of computer vision and NLP neural networks.

+Tensor Boost Engine(TBE): is an efficient custom operator development tool, from hardware to application programming interfaces (APIs). 

+The complier at the bottom : provides performance optimization to support Ascend Al processors in all scenarios.

5.	Based on your current knowledge and understanding, please elaborate on the development trends of artificial intelligence in the future in your view.

In my opinion in the future lawyers will be a part of artificial intelligence because it can be applied to terms and replace humans in this. And one more job that will replace people in the future is teaching because many years later artificial intelligence will develop more and more and artificial intelligence will replace teachers to teach.
